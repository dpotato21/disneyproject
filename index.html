		<p class="history">Many people know that Disney was originally started by Walt Disney. In 1923, Walt and his brother Roy began the company. Contrary to popular belief, Mickey Mouse was not Walt's first creation. He actually started off creating Alice's Wonderland, which was about a young girl in an animated world. These went on to be known as Alice Comedies. After a contract mishap regarding the rights to Alice Comedies, Walt went on to create a new character. This character would end up being one of the most iconic symbols of the entertainment indusry. After three attempts, Mickey Mouse was born.</p>
