	<p class="description">This Emmy winning show follows the Simpsons family consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Margaret. This wild family goes on multiple adventures and it is never truly clear to the audience what will occur within each episode. Which is what has kept so many fans entertained for so long. The show has set many records, one of their most famous ones being the "Longest Running Show" in American television with 32 current seasons.</p>

	<p class="description">The concept within itself is pretty simple, judges are supposed to guess singers who are physically hidden through crazy wacky costumes. Some people find it entertaining, others disagree. Everyone that I know that watches the show, either loves it or views it as a complete and toal waste of time.</p>

	<p class="description">Despite the name, Dance Moms is not actually about moms who dance. Instead it's about girls who learn to dance and enter into different competitions all over the country. Dance Moms is also a reality show, so some reactions may either be dramatic or funny. Either way, it's been enough to keep many people still watching for a long time.</p>

	<p class="description">Legion is based off of Marvel comics and deals with the son of famous X-Man, Xavier Charles. Legion is the actual name of Xavier's child, and unlike his father, he has not completely embraced the title "hero", as he struggles with schizophrenia. A troubled young man with abilities leads to very interesting stories and plotlines.</p>

	<p class="description">Similar to how Simpsons deal with the Simpson family, Family Guy deals with the Grriffin family and how they go about their daily lives. Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Brian, and of course Stewie. The show constantly provides dark humour episode after episode, and has attracted thousands of people to the series. Family Guy does not limit themselves to one idea, isntead they are always looking for ways to improvise and make the show better season after season.</p>
